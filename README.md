# Final Project Proposal  Multiplayer Game

## Project Overview

For my final project, I would like to build a Multiplayer game (no name yet), where two players can connect and compete in a simple arena based battle. Each player will control a customizable character on a 2D grid and take turns performing actions like moving, attacking, or defending. The goal is to reduce the opponent’s health to zero. The game will be web-based with API handling game state, multiplayer synchronization, and turn logic.

I'm choosing this project because I’ve always liked videogames, and I’m excited about the challenge of making something interactive and competitive. This project will help me practice managing real-time multiplayer logic, and implementing basic turn-based mechanics. I also want to make something that is visually fun to play.
